    <p>The activity I completed was GCFLearnFree: Internet Basics. I learned The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. 
      The servers are actually connected by cables all over the world. I also learned about using special techniques for searching the internet. Using special techniques 
      like a hyphen to remove words from a search. Or using quotation marks for exact words or phrases. I also learned about URLs. Each portion of the URL has different 
      parts of the address, and each gives you a different information. Scheme, domain name, file path, parameters, and anchors are the most common parts.</p>
