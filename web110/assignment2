    <p>The first activity completed was, TutorialsPoint: Web Browser. The activity was about web Browsers which is an application software that allows 
    us to view and explore information on the web. Users can view a web page by entering a URL into the address bar. A web browser interprets text and commands contained 
    in the web page. I learned that the most basic components that all web browsers must exhibit are Controller/Dispatcher, Interpreter, and Client Programs. Some of the 
    client programs that are used are HTTP, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, and POP. Understanding more about the web and how it works will help me to know how coding will affect a web page.</p>
