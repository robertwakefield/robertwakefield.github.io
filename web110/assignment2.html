    <p>The first activity completed was, TutorialsPoint: Web Browser. The activity was about web Browsers which is an application software that allows 
      us to view and explore information on the web. Users can view a web page by entering a URL into the address bar. A web browser interprets text and commands contained 
      in the web page. I learned that the most basic components that all web browsers must exhibit are Controller/Dispatcher, Interpreter, and Client Programs. Some of the 
      client programs that are used are HTTP, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, and POP. Understanding more about the web and how it works will help me to know how coding will affect a web page.

      GCFLearnFree Internet Tips was the second activity that I completed. The activity was about strategies to get the most out of the Internet, from understanding hyperlinks to installing browser plug-ins. 
      I learned that the status bar displays the URL of a link when you hover the mouse over it. This technique can help you determine if the link is a phishing scam or a trojan. I can apply this by using the 
      status bar to help keep me safe online by viewing the URL before clicking on the link. By checking links first, I can avoid suspicious websites.</p>
