    <p>The first activity that I completed was GCFLearnFree: Search Better. Digital literacy is an important skill for finding what you are looking for quickly. 
      Search engines are important to help you find information. Some strategies for searching include keeping it simple, considering suggestions, and using natural 
      language. Google search has several hidden features to simplify your online experience such as finding places near me, performing mathematical equations, converting
      many types of measurements, providing definitions and translations, and several others. I use Google every day for many practical uses like checking the weather, 
      getting directions to a location, getting conversions, or solving math problems. The main use is of course searching for various things on the internet. 
      The second activity that I completed was TutorialsPoint: Search Engines. 
      A search engine helps you to find information on the web. There are several components to a search engine to make searching easier and more efficient. A spider
      collects info about webpages. The info about the web pages is then indexed. The search algorithm ranks the most relevant results based on the user's query. The user
      interface is what the user sees and interacts with on the webpage. Google is the most popular search engine providing the most comprehensive results accurately 
      and quickly. Understanding how search engines work will help me search more effectively</p>
