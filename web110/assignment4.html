    <h1>Session #4</h1>
    
    <p>Activity 1: GCF Global: Email Basics is the first activity I compleed. I learned about emails. Webmail providers offerÂ various tools. These tools 
      include instant messaging, an address book, a calendar, and a public profile. When you sign up for Gmail you will have access to many additional Google services 
      like Google Docs and Google Drive. These features help you work, communicate, and stay organized. Google tools have been helpful in my day-to-day activities. It is 
      convenient to add appointments to my calendar from my Gmail. It is helpful so I don't have to go to another app to add them. </p>
    
     <p>Activity 3; Use an email client program is the second activity I completed. I learned about Mozilla Thunderbird, which is a free and open-source email client that also 
      serves as a personal information manager. It includes features such as a calendar, contact book, RSS feed reader, chat client, and news client. Thunderbird emphasizes 
      user privacy and security, offering strong encryption and effective spam filtering. It is available for various operating systems and is well-known for its 
      customization options and extensive support for add-ons. his was interesting to learn about because I never heard of this email client before. Knowing about this 
      email client gives me an oportuninty to try a new service and compare it to others I have used in the past. </p>
