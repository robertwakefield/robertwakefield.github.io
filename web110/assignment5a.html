    <h1>Session #5a</h1>
    
    <p>The first activity completed was GCFLearnFree: Blog Basics. A blog is a regularly updated website featuring informal articles called blog posts, which may include text, photos, videos, and other media. Essentially, 
      a blog serves as a platform to express opinions, experiences, and interests. While many popular blogs resemble online magazines with a team of writers, most 
      blogs are personal, reflecting the individual writer's personality and interests. Knowing about blogs gives me another outlet to express myself. Its exciting to know that
      there are several different approaches that I can take with blogs.</p>
    
    <p>The second activity completed was GCFLearnFree: Pinterest. Pinterest is a popular social network focused on collecting and sharing online discoveries. Unlike other platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest serves 
      as a digital bulletin board or scrapbook for organizing information. For example, if you love finding new recipes, you can save them to a board, which will link 
      back to the original website, creating a collection of visual bookmarks. You can also follow other users, or pinners, and easily save their pins to your own boards.I currently have a Pinterest account. 
      I have many boards created to save things like quotes, food ideas, art, design, and photos for inspiration.</p>
