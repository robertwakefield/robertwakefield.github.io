    <p>The activity I completed was 1. Internet Services. Internet services provide access to vast amounts of information, including text, graphics, sound, and software.
      They can be categorized into four types: Communication Services (like email, instant messaging, and internet telephony), Information Retrieval Services (such as
      FTP and gopher), Web Services (which facilitate information exchange between applications), and the World Wide Web (a method to access documents across multiple 
      servers). Understanding how internet services work will help me better utilize the services I use on a regular basis.</p>
