    <p>The first activity completed was TutorialsPoint: Internet Reference Models. Reference models, such as OSI and TCP/IP, provide a standardized framework for 
      communication between diverse network devices. The OSI model, developed by ISO, consists of seven layers that each serve specific functions. In contrast, 
      the practical TCP/IP model combines the Physical and Data Link layers into a single Host-to-Network layer, consisting of four layers: Application, Transport, 
      Internet, and Host-to-Network. Both models facilitate efficient and compatible data transmission across heterogeneous networks, ensuring that devices can communicate 
      effectively, regardless of their underlying architecture or protocol differences. I can apply this concept breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, 
      Just like network communication is broken down into layers.</p>

     <p>The Second activity completed was Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that 
       ensures end-to-end packet delivery through features like stream data transfer and efficient flow control. It uses acknowledgement for reliability and manages 
       sending/receiving buffers for data flow. In contrast, Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are connectionless and unreliable, transmitting 
       data in datagrams without ensuring delivery. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) enables secure file transfers with authentication, while Trivial File Transfer Protocol 
       (TFTP) transfers files without authentication, lacking security features. Telnet allows remote login to computers over the internet. Understanding TCP can help me 
       optimize loading times, reduce latency, and improve real-time interactions for chat apps and live streaming.</p>
