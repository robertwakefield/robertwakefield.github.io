    <p>The first activity completed was GCFLearnFree: Internet Safety. Creating strong passwords is crucial for online security. Use long, memorable passwords that are difficult for others to guess, 
      and avoid personal information. Aim for at least six characters, incorporate numbers, symbols, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Don't reuse passwords 
      across accounts to prevent widespread vulnerability if one is compromised. Steer clear of dictionary words, as they weaken security. Consider using a password 
      generator for robust passwords. Knowing this information has been helpful for my security. I am using a password manager to help me with my passwords.</p>
     
    <p>The second activity completed was TutorialsPoint: Internet Security. Internet security involves safeguarding online communications using protocols like IPSec and SSL,
      which ensure privacy, integrity, and authentication. However, various threats, including mobile worms, malware, ransomware, hacking services, spam, and phishing,
      jeopardize network and data security. Phishing emails impersonate legitimate enterprises to steal sensitive information, featuring signs like poor grammar, 
      suspicious links, and threats of account closure. Users should avoid such emails and remain vigilant against counterfeit websites. Learning more about threats 
      online has made me more aware and causious with what I click on.</p>
